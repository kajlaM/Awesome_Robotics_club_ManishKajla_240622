MY motivation for joining the summer projects of Robo club against this Kanpur ki garmi is gateway to building something real and impactful.
I have applying for two projects first is Autonomous Navigation and second one is StepXplorer . 
Imagine a robot navigating on its own—because we made it smart enough to do so. 
we'll not only sharpen our coding and problem-solving skills but also collaborate with like-minded innovators and learn hands-on systems like sensors, path planning, and control logic. 
It's not just a project—it's our first step toward mastering the future of robotics .
For the second one is building a robot that can detect and climb stairs isn’t just cool—it’s cutting-edge.
It pushes us to dive deep into real-world robotics challenges like sensor integration, mechanical design, and smart path planning. 
This project will test our creativity, logic, and teamwork, and in return, it’ll give us hands-on experience that textbooks can’t offer.
stair-climbing robots have practical uses in rescue missions, delivery systems, and autonomous mobility we will be solving a real problem .
At the end of the day cv main likhne ko kuch cool milega .
