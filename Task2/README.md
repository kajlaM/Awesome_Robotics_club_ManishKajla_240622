robot ko start (S) se goal (G) tak grid world world main navigate kerwana hai. robot obstacles (#) ko avoid kre, and traverse terrains with different movement costs:

. → cost 1 (normal)
~ → cost 3 (mud)
^ → cost 5 (hill)
# → impassable
S and G → start and goal (cost 0)
Objective
least cost path dundhana hai ,jaruri nahi ki shortest path h ho, informed path-planning algorithms ka use kerke.

Algorithm Used
A* (A-star) Search Algorithm
Combines:

g(n): cost from start to current node
h(n): Manhattan distance to goal
f(n) = g(n) + h(n): total estimated cost
Why A*?
It ensures we always expand the most promising node first .

Heuristic Function
We used Manhattan Distance since movement is limited to 4 directions (uper, niche, left, right).

Grid Format
The grid was hardcoded as a 2D char array with a corresponding cost map.

Output
Prints visited coordinates step-by-step.
At the end, prints total cost of the optimal path.
How to Run
g++ main.cpp -o pathfinder
./pathfinder
